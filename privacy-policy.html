<h2 id="section8">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<div class="highlight">
<p>StoryBloom is designed for use by families with children. The app is intended to be used by children under the supervision of a parent or guardian.</p>
</div>

<p>We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable children's privacy laws:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not require children to provide personal information beyond what is necessary to generate stories.</li>
    <li>Child profile information (first name, age, interests) is used solely for story personalization and is not used for advertising, profiling, or shared with third parties for their own purposes.</li>
    <li>We do not collect contact information from children.</li>
    <li>A parent or guardian may request to review, delete, or stop the collection of their child's personal information at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:storybloom.app@gmail.com">storybloom.app@gmail.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to promptly delete that information.</p>

<h2 id="section9">9. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>StoryBloom uses artificial intelligence to generate story text, illustrations, and audio narration. When you use these features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your story preferences and personalization data are sent to our AI providers (OpenAI for text and images, ElevenLabs for audio) to generate content.</li>
    <li>AI-generated content is provided "as-is." While we implement safety filters and content validation, we cannot guarantee that all generated content will be perfectly suitable.</li>
    <li>You may opt out of AI-based processing by discontinuing use of the Services. To request deletion of data already processed, contact us at <a href="mailto:storybloom.app@gmail.com">storybloom.app@gmail.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section10">10. Do-Not-Track Signals</h2>
<p>Our app does not track your browsing activity across other websites or services. We do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track (DNT) browser signals, as there is no uniform standard for interpreting them. We do not engage in cross-site tracking.</p>

<h2 id="section11">11. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page. If we make material changes, we will notify users through the app. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
